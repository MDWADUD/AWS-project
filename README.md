# AWS-project
fetching data from random open API and send them to the AWS S3 Bucket

In order run the server we have to download the main.py file and run it. Once the server start runing, then we have to run the client_request.py file for requesting to the server for information that we are expected. 

However, this server stop running for now because I push my AWS S3. But if I tune up my S3 bucket it will start againg.
